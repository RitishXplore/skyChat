# SkyChat

SkyChat is a messaging and communication platform designed for seamless communication across multiple users. It supports real-time messaging, voice/video calling, group chats, and more. With a focus on scalability and performance, SkyChat is built to cater to individual users and larger groups. In the future, we plan to enhance the app's scalability using Redis, Kafka, and RabbitMQ.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: 
  - Email and phone verification.
  - Support for Google, GitHub, and Facebook authentication.
  
- **Real-time Messaging**:
  - 1:1 direct messaging and group chats.
  - Support for text, media (images, videos, etc.), and file sharing.
  - Chat status (sent, delivered, read).
  
- **Voice/Video Calls**:
  - Real-time audio and video calls with multiple participants.
  - Call status (ongoing, ended, missed).
  
- **Group Management**:
  - Create groups, add/remove members, assign roles (admin/member).
  - Admin-only settings for groups.
  
- **User Profile and Settings**:
  - Manage profile picture, name, and status.
  - Privacy and notification settings.

- **Presence and Activity Tracking**:
  - Track user presence (online/offline).
  - Show last seen and activity status (Available, Do Not Disturb).
  
- **Message Reactions**:
  - Users can react to messages with emojis (e.g., like, love, laugh).

- **Push Notifications**:
  - Receive notifications for new messages, calls, mentions, and more.
  
- **Blocked List and Reports**:
  - Block or report users for spam, harassment, or inappropriate behavior.
  
- **Polls and Voting**:
  - Create and vote in polls in group chats.

- **Encryption**:
  - Support for message encryption and decryption for privacy.

## Backend Structure

SkyChat uses a well-organized backend structure built on MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js (MERN Stack). Here are some of the important models used:

- **User Model**: Stores user information like name, email, phone number, role, and activity status.
- **OTP Model**: Stores OTP details for phone/email verification.
- **Session Model**: Manages user sessions and authentication tokens.
- **Group Model**: Represents groups with members, roles, and settings.
- **Chat Model**: Stores messages exchanged between users or groups.
- **Call Model**: Tracks voice/video calls and their statuses.
- **Verification Model**: Handles verification tokens for email/phone verification.
- **Settings Model**: Stores user preferences like theme, notification, and privacy settings.
- **Presence Model**: Tracks user online status and last activity.
- **BlockedList Model**: Manages blocked and reported users.
- **Polls Model**: Stores polls and voting options in groups.
- **Encryption Model**: Handles message encryption keys for secure communication.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Scalability**: 
   - Implement Redis for caching and session management.
   - Use Kafka and RabbitMQ for handling real-time events, message queuing, and distributed systems.

2. **Cross-platform Support**:
   - Native mobile applications (iOS/Android) using React Native.
   
3. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Track user behavior, message frequency, and app usage for better insights.

4. **Admin Panel**:
   - A web-based admin panel to monitor user activity, manage groups, and handle reports.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
